Propaedeutic might be fancy word, but I have found it to be extremely useful. Propaedeutic comes from the ancient greek ‘propaideusis’ translated as “preparatory education”. I take it as the knowledge to be obtained before you learn a discipline, before you play football you need to learn how to run, how to kick a ball, game rules come later. Today It was about propaedeutics.


The apprenticeship is a unique opportunity to learn, dwell deeper in the craft of software developing, but also to explore what does it mean to be an apprentice and how to think and live this experience in the best manner.


Going through the wiki I came across a book called ‘Apprenticeship Patterns’. The book defines patterns as a ‘named description of a recurring solution to a problem in a given context’, and in that light it offers you several patterns to design a better apprenticeship and therefore software career.

Might sound confusing, let me clarify. So let’s break down the definition “named description of a recurring solution” and example of that is “Expose your ignorance”, that is proposed solution, but to what problem? One that affects me quite directly as a beginner, being that there is a vast amount of things I don’t know about. Considering that issue, thee proposed pattern is to be vocal about your knowledge shortcomes instead of trying to hide them under the rug, is a good practice that will facilitate learning much more that quietness.


Just like that, the book goes through other patterns, such as keeping a White Belt mentality, learning concrete skills and “emptying your cup”. I read through a bunch of them and plan to continue to do so in order to plan my apprenticeship in the best way possible, as to be able to take advantage of this instance very early in the process. 


Why propaedeutic? Because today it was about taking one step back and looking the whole experience of the apprenticeship and the meaning of it from a distance. I’m learning how to learn better.
